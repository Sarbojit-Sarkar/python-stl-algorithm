# Python-stl-algorithm

I have created Python-stl-algorithm project purely for learning & fun purpose(as of now)

Python has a lot of inbuilt functions which makes it very powerful. We also know how useful CPP STL algorithms. This project is 
to add any STL functionality that is missing today in python. Even it is not in CPP STL you one thinks that it is good to have, feel free to add it.

To start with I have written few CPP STL algorithms and a test.py file for testing functions.  

## Do's and Don'ts 
- Whole intention is to share knowledge hence try to clearly call out the purpose/functionality/use cases/limitations (if any) in the comment section in each function.
- For better maintenance, it would be good to have one file for each category hence before creating any new file try to check if your function can be added into any of the existing files.
- For every new function, one should have test cases which should cover negative and positive test case

## How can one contribute in the repository? 
This repository is open for anyone who has started learning python and wants to get his/her hands dirty. There is a number of ways one can contribute 
- Adding new functions
- Adding new test cases for existing functions 
- Reporting bugs in existing code
- By raising new feature requests.
